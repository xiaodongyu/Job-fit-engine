I created a **QA manifest JSON mapping** that links each resume to its corresponding add-on material and defines:

* **Ground-truth role-fit distribution (before)**
* **Expected delta behavior** after adding supplemental materials
* **Target role-fit distribution (after)** for regression testing
* **Expected new evidence themes** and **explicit QA assertions**
* **Global thresholds** for evidence and distribution error tolerances

Contents:

* `qa_manifest.json`
* `README.txt` (how to apply it in your QA harness)
