# Tech Career Fit Engine - Cursor Rules

## Project Structure
- Keep MVP minimal: ONLY backend/ and frontend/ at repo root.
- No over-engineering:
  - No user accounts/auth, no complex DB, no background job systems.
  - Small readable modules only.

## RAG Architecture
- RAG must be DIY with FAISS (no hosted vector store).
- Pipeline: parse → chunk → embed → FAISS.
- Must use Gemini API via google-genai SDK for:
  - Embeddings: gemini-embedding-001
  - Generation: configurable model from env (e.g., GEMINI_MODEL)

## Grounding Rules (CRITICAL)
- Strict grounding:
  - Resume bullets must be supported by retrieved resume chunks; otherwise put into Need Info.
  - Requirements must be supported by curated JD chunks or user-pasted JD text; never invent requirements.
- If unsure, do not guess.
- Never fabricate skills, experiences, or qualifications not found in source documents.

## Upload Status
- Implement upload status tracking:
  - POST /resume/upload returns upload_id
  - GET /resume/status reports parsing/chunking/embedding/indexing/ready

## Deterministic Steps
- Prefer deterministic steps:
  - Structured JSON intermediate outputs where reasonable.
  - If unsure, do not guess.

## Authentication
- Don't add auth/login. Use session_id only.
- Store session_id in localStorage on frontend.
- Sessions are in-memory on backend (acceptable for MVP).

## Code Style
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose.
- Use Pydantic models for all request/response schemas.
- Use TypeScript on frontend with proper typing.
- Avoid over-engineering; solve the current problem, not hypothetical future ones.
